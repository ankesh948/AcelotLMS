                <p className='cont'> While classroom training offers direct interaction and structured learning, it can be limited by time, location, and scalability. Our platform bridges these gaps by offering both self-paced and instructor-led learning, providing your team with the freedom to learn at their own pace while maintaining personalised guidance.</p>
                <p className='cont'>We enhance this experience with advanced, adaptive technologies that ensure every learner gets the most relevant and engaging content tailored to their needs. With Acelot, you get the best of both worldsâ€”combining the structure and personal touch of traditional training with the flexibility and scalability of modern learning solutions.
